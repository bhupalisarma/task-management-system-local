# Task Manager

Task Manager is a web application built with React on the frontend and TypeScript and Node.js on the backend. It allows users to register, log in, create tasks, view their task list, and delete tasks.


## Backend Technologies Used

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side development.
- Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the development of RESTful APIs.
- MySQL: Relational database management system used for storing user and task data.
- Sequelize: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Node.js used to interact with the MySQL database.

## Frontend Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for creating the frontend of the Task Manager application.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework used for styling the frontend components.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following:

- MySQL server running on your machine.
- Node.js installed on your machine.

## Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <backend-repo-url> task-manager-server`
2. Make sure your MySQL server is running.
3. Navigate to the backend directory: `cd task-manager-server`
4. Install dependencies: `npm install`
5. Start the server: `npm run dev`

The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:8000`.

## Frontend Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <frontend-repo-url> task-manager-client`
2. Make sure your MySQL server is running.
3. Ensure that the backend server is running.
4. Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd task-manager-client`
5. Install dependencies: `npm install`
6. Start the development server: `npm start`

The frontend development server should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the Task Manager application.
